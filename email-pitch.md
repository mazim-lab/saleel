## Template 2: Outdated Website

**Subject:** Thought about [Business Name] — quick idea

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Business Name]'s website and wanted to reach out. Your business clearly does great work — but I think your website might be holding you back a bit.

Here's what a refresh would look like:
- Modern, mobile-first design
- SEO so you show up on Google
- Done in 48 hours, starting at $1,500

No pressure at all — but if you're curious, I'd love to show you a quick mockup. Free of charge, no strings.

Best,

## Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried — I know how busy things get running a business.

If a new website isn't on your radar right now, no worries at all. But if you ever want to chat about getting online or refreshing your current site, the offer stands.

Have a great week,
[Name]
