# Saleel — Lead Research Strategy & Initial List

## How to Find Businesses Without Good Websites

### Method 1: Google Maps Search (Most Effective)
Search Google Maps for business categories in Durham Region. Businesses that show "Add Website" instead of a website link are prime targets.

**Search queries to use:**
- "restaurants Oshawa" → filter by ones without website
- "hair salon Whitby" → check each listing
- "plumber Ajax" → look for phone-only listings
- "contractor Pickering"
- "bakery Durham Region"
- "auto repair Oshawa"
- "nail salon Whitby"
- "cleaning service Ajax"
- "landscaping Durham Region"
- "dentist Oshawa" (some smaller practices have no sites)

### Method 2: Yellow Pages Cross-Reference
Search YellowPages.ca for Durham Region businesses → visit their listed "website" → check if it's broken, outdated, or non-existent.

### Method 3: Facebook-Only Businesses
Many small businesses ONLY have a Facebook page, no website. Search Facebook for:
- "Oshawa" + business categories
- Durham Region community groups → businesses advertising there

### Method 4: Google Search for Poor Websites
Search: `"Oshawa" + [category] + "call us"` — businesses with phone-only presence
Search: `site:wix.com Oshawa` or `site:wordpress.com Oshawa` — businesses with free-tier sites (easy upgrade sell)

### Method 5: Walk Simcoe St / King St (Downtown Oshawa)
Physically walk the main streets and note businesses. Cross-reference online.

## Action Plan for Cold Outreach

### Phase 1: Build List (10 per day target)

3. Verify they're still active (check Google Maps reviews, last activity)
4. Add to CRM spreadsheet

### Phase 2: Email Campaign
- Send 10 personalized cold emails per day
- Use templates from `email-pitch.md`
- Track opens and replies
- Follow up after 3 days if no response
- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM

### Phase 3: Facebook Outreach
